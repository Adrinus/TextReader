# TextReader
Love 2D Text Reader, for plain text documents.


A and D change the font.
W and S switch backgrounds.

Drag and Drop any text file (Even ones not ending in txt, but not word processor documents) onto the window to load them for reading.

P or Right Arrow for Next Page, O or Left Arrow for Previous Page
